# My dot files

Here are my personal dotfiles and a script to maintain them for this repo.

I found the makesymlink.sh script on smalleycreative.com and tailored it to my needs.
- Makes a directory for the old\_dotfiles in ~
- Copy the current dotfiles into ~/old\_dotfiles/ 
- create symlinks to dotfiles from repo.
Note: The dotfiles directory where the script is run, needs to be a child of the ~ directory (ex. ~/dotfiles).
