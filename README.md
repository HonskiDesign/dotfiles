# My dot files

Here are my personal dotfiles and a script to maintain them for this repo. I found the makesymlink.sh script on smalleycreative.com and tailored it to my needs. It simply makes a directory for the old\_dotfiles in ~, copies the current dotfiles there into the ~/old\_dotfiles/ dir, and creates syminks to the ones in this directory. Note: The dotfiles directory in which the script is called needs to be a child of the parent directory like so ~/dotfiles/.
